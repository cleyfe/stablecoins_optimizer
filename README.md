# Stablecoins Optimizer

## Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive stablecoins optimizer that integrates multiple DeFi protocols to borrow, lend, and optimize stablecoin strategies. By leveraging various DeFi platforms, this tool helps users make informed decisions about their stablecoin management and yield generation.

## Objectives
The Stablecoins Optimizer is designed to answer critical questions and perform actions such as:

- Identifying the cheapest borrowing options across multiple protocols
- Finding the best yield-generating opportunities for stablecoins
- Executing optimized strategies automatically
- Analyzing historical trends in stablecoin yields and borrowing rates
- Providing a unified programmatic interface for interacting with multiple DeFi protocols

## Current State
- Implemented Aave protocol integration
- Planning to add more protocol integrations
- Historical data analysis and trend identification

## Planned Features
- Multi-protocol integration (Aave, Compound, Curve, etc.)
- Real-time data fetching and analysis
- Automated strategy execution

## Getting Started
TBD
